- Python 3.8+ and Pip
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Collab-X
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:

    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser to access the admin panel:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

6.  **Run the development server:**

    Since this project uses Django Channels, it must be run with an ASGI server like `daphne` to handle both HTTP and WebSocket traffic.

    ```bash
    daphne -p 8000 Collab-X.asgi:application
    ```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
